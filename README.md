Theme 'Modern TV' - 2023-03-14 by Lilbud
Theme based on "Modern" by Rookervik

Port of my Modern TV theme to the new EmulationStation-DE. It's actually a modification of a theme called "Modern" by Rookervik. 

Thanks to the ES-DE Discord for helping me out with the new theming system. 

Various colorSchemes included, as well as auto-switching to a "basic" layout when there is no media. Plus a Video layout as well.
